        <p class="mb-4">
            This system predicts student performance based on various factors such as attendance, previous grades, study hours, assignment scores, and participation in extracurricular activities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            By uploading a CSV file with the necessary data, the system will use our trained model to predict the final grade and categorize the performance of students.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The predicted final grade will be displayed along with visualizations showing the distribution of grades and performance categories.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The goal of this system is to provide insights into student performance, helping educators and students to identify areas of improvement and achieve better academic outcomes.
